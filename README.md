Create a README.md file and for each algorithm include the following:

* Explain to a five year old how the algorithm works (3-4 sentences max)
* Psuedo code for each sorting implementation
* In your own words, describe the performance of the alogirthm for the following cases:
    * Best case scenario
    * Worst case scenario

###Bubble Sort

Bubbles go up from underwater because air is lighter than water. In a bubble sort, the first item traverses (or "bubbles") through the list and swaps position with the next item if the next item is larger (or "heavier") than itself. The item will keep traversing through the list until it reaches the end or when the next item is no longer larger, in which case, the item at the start of this new list takes over and begins its journey bubbling up. This process repeats over and over again until no more swaps can be made.

###Insertion Sort
